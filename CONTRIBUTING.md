## Code Style and Formatting

We use ESLint and Prettier to enforce code style and formatting standards. These tools are configured in the project, so
your code should automatically adhere to the defined standards. However, please ensure that your changes maintain
consistent code style.

## Areas for Contribution

One area where contributions are needed is in expanding the list of OAuth providers and their corresponding endpoints
and configurations. You can contribute by adding support for new providers or endpoints. Check the existing providers
and endpoints to avoid duplication.
